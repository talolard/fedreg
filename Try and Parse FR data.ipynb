       "      <th>In the 2008 Arkansas Regional Haze SIP, the State determined that there were eighteen facilities in Arkansas with BART-eligible sources.33 34\\n The State chose to exempt those sources that did not contribute to visibility impairment by performing a source-specific screening analysis using CALPUFF modeling. After eliminating BART-eligible sources whose modeled contributions to visibility impairment were below the 0.5 dv threshold limit, nine boiler units from six different facilities were found to be subject-to-BART 35\\n and are reflected in Table 2.2 of the progress report.36\\n In addition to these subject-to-BART units determined by the State in the 2008 Arkansas Regional Haze SIP, the progress report also included additional units from Georgia-Pacific Paper. As discussed in section I.B of this proposed action, the BART portion of the 2008 Arkansas Regional Haze SIP was partially approved and partially disapproved in our 2012 final action.37\\n We approved Arkansas' identification of BART-eligible sources from the 2008 Arkansas Regional Haze SIP with the exception of Georgia-Pacific's 6A Boiler, which we found to be BART-eligible, instead of being excluded as stated by the State in the 2008 Arkansas Regional Haze SIP. The EPA also approved the State's identification of subject-to-BART sources, with the exception of the 6A and 9A Boilers at Georgia-Pacific, which we found to be subject-to-BART instead of exempt.38\\n Because of this, the progress report included Georgia-Pacific's 6A and 9A Boilers as subject-to-BART at the time of its submittal in 2015. However, despite the EPA's previous disapproval of ADEQ's exemption finding, following the company's recent submission of additional technical information and analyses, the EPA ultimately agreed that Georgia Pacific's 6A and 9A Power Boilers are BART-eligible, but are not subject-to-BART. ADEQ provided documentation supporting this determination in Appendix A of the 2018 Arkansas Regional Haze SO2 and PM SIP revision that the EPA proposed for approval on November 30, 2018. Therefore, the State's most recent identification of subject-to-BART units in the Arkansas Regional Haze SO2 and PM SIP revision is the same as originally presented in the 2008 Arkansas Regional Haze SIP (see Table 1):</th>\n",

As those programs have changed over the last two decades, HHS-OIG has received new fraud-fighting CMP authorities in response. Section 231 of HIPAA expanded the reach of CMPs to include federal health programs other than those funded by HHS. In 1977, Congress first mandated the exclusion of physicians and other practitioners convicted of program-related crimes from participation in Medicare and Medicaid through the Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments, Public Law 95-142 (now codified at section 1128 of the Social Security Act (the SSA)). This was followed in 1981 with Congress enacting the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (CMPL), Public Law 97-35, section 1128A of the SSA, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a, to further address health care fraud and abuse. The CMPL authorized the Secretary to impose penalties and assessments on a person, as defined in 42 CFR part 1003, who defrauded Medicare or Medicaid or engaged in certain other wrongful conduct. The CMPL also authorized the Secretary of Health and Human Services to exclude persons from Medicare and all State health care programs (including Medicaid). Congress later expanded the CMPL and the scope of exclusion to apply to all Federal health care programs. The Secretary of HHS delegated the CMPL's authorities to HHS-OIG. 53 FR 12993 (April 20, 1988). Since 1981, Congress has created various other CMP authorities covering numerous types of fraud and abuse.

This final rule is not subject to the requirements of E.O. 13771 (82 FR 9339, February 3, 2017) because it is issued with respect to a national security function of the United States. The cost-benefit analysis required pursuant to Executive Orders 13563 and 12866 indicates that this rule is intended to improve national security as its primary direct benefit. Specifically, the change in the Country Group designations for Venezuela and its impact on the availability of license exceptions and more restrictive license review policies described herein will enhance the national security of the United States by reducing the risk that exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items subject to the EAR could be diverted and contribute to the military capability of countries of concern, contrary to U.S. national security interests. This final rule will allow the U.S. Government to review transactions involving military end uses or end users in Venezuela prior to their completion to mitigate this risk. Accordingly, this rule meets the requirements set forth in the April 5, 2017, OMB guidance implementing E.O. 13771 (82 FR 9339, February 3, 2017), regarding what constitutes a regulation issued “with respect to a national security function of the United States” and it is, therefore, exempt from the requirements of E.O. 13771.</th>\n",
