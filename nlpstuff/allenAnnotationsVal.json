International trade in specimens of Appendix II species is authorized through a system of permits or certificates under certain circumstances.

The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public comment, and a 30-day delay in effective date are inapplicable because this regulation involves a military or foreign affairs function of the United States. (See 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)). The U.S. Government's original basis for adding the entities affected by this rule to the Entity List was the entities' involvement in activities contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests. BIS implements this rule to further protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests by preventing items from being exported, reexported or transferred (in-country) to these persons listed on the Entity List and by ensuring that potential transactions with individuals no longer listed on the Entity List are not turned away to the detriment of U.S. economic interests. If this rule were delayed to allow for notice and comment and a 30-day delay in effective date, there is a chance that certain exporters, reexporters, and persons making transfers (in-country) to this listed person may inadvertently export, reexport or transfer (in-country) to Olkebor Oy/Nurminen Oy because the exporter, reexporter or person making the transfer (in-country) did not realize the listed person was subject to the Entity List-based license requirement. There is also a chance an exporter, reexporter, or person making a transfer (in-country) may turn away a potential export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) because the customer remained a listed person on the Entity List after the ERC approved removal, thereby harming U.S. economic interests. The correction and removals provided in this rule may make clear that the persons are no longer subject to Entity List-based license requirements. For these reasons, there is a public interest that these changes be implemented as a final action. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule by 5 U.S.C. 553, or by any other law, the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., are not applicable.", "metadata": {"title": "Removal of Persons From the Entity List Based on Removal Request; Implementation of Entity List Annual Review Changes; and Implementation of Modifications and Corrections to the Entity List", "agency": "DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE", "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2013/16/01/2013-00767.html", "type": "rule", "order_code": 49, "doc_id": "2013-00767"}}, {"id": "ee17579f2f224ee4a777715cfaac0451", "annotations": [{"end": 278, "start": 272, "tag": "Treaty", "overlap": NaN, "value": "treaty", "example_id": "ee17579f2f224ee4a777715cfaac0451"}], "content": "(d)(1) When the agency head or duly authorized designee determines at the time of contracting that it would be in the national interest to acquire the right to sublicense foreign governments, their nationals, or international organizations in accordance with any existing treaty or international agreement, a sentence may be added at the end of paragraph (b) of the clause at \u00a7\u2009401.14 as follows:", "metadata": {"end": 305, "title": "Rights to Federally Funded Inventions and Licensing of Government Owned Inventions", "start": 282, "key": "international agreement", "order_code": 169, "agency": "DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE", "type": "rule", "phrase": "international agreement", "doc_id": "[FR Doc. 2018-07532 Filed 4-12-18; 8:45 am]"}}, {"id": "9e7b44a1e9d4443cb49b7ef9c78f59bb", "annotations": [{"end": 570, "start": 530, "tag": "Treaty", "overlap": NaN, "value": "Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty", "example_id": "9e7b44a1e9d4443cb49b7ef9c78f59bb"}], "content": "BIS, pursuant to Section 744.11(b) of the EAR, and in consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Energy and the Treasury, has designated the two persons, located in the Russian Federation, to be added to the Entity List for actions contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.

The changes proposed in this rule and the State Department's companion rule to Category IV of the USML are based on a review of this USML Category by the Defense Department, which worked with the Departments of State and Commerce in preparing the proposed amendments. The review focused on identifying the types of articles that are now controlled by USML Category IV that are either: (i) Inherently military and otherwise warrant control on the USML or (ii) of a type common to non-military applications, possessing parameters or characteristics that provide a critical military or intelligence advantage to the United States, and almost exclusively available from the United States.
