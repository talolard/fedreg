On June 1, 2023, the IRS mails an FPA to Partnership for Partnership's 2020 year increasing the amount of U.S. source dividend income to $4,000 and determining that a 20 percent accuracy-related penalty under section 6662(b) applies to the increase in U.S. source dividend income. Partnership makes a timely election under section 6226 in accordance with \u00a7\u2009301.6226-1 with respect to the imputed underpayment in the FPA for Partnership's 2020 year and does not file a petition for readjustment under section 6234. The time to file a petition expires on August 30, 2023. Pursuant to \u00a7\u2009301.6226-2(b), the partnership adjustments become finally determined on August 30, 2023.

C had a 50 percent interest in Partnership during all of 2020 and was allocated 50 percent of all items from Partnership for that year. The statement shows C's share of U.S. source dividend income reported on Partnership's return for the reviewed year of $1,000 and an adjustment to U.S. source dividend income of $1,000. In addition, the statement reports that a 20 percent accuracy-related penalty under section 6662(b) applies. Under \u00a7\u2009301.6226-2(h)(3)(i), because the additional $1,000 in U.S. source dividend income allocated to C is an amount subject to withholding (as defined in \u00a7\u2009301.6226-2(h)(3)(i)), Partnership must pay the amount of tax required to be withheld on the adjustment.

Partnership makes a timely election under section 6226 in accordance with \u00a7\u2009301.6226-1 with respect to the imputed underpayment in the FPA for Partnership's 2020 year and does not file a petition for readjustment under section 6234. The time to file a petition expires on August 30, 2023. Pursuant to \u00a7\u2009301.6226-2(b), the partnership adjustments become finally determined on August 30, 2023.

C had a 50 percent interest in Partnership during all of 2020 and was allocated 50 percent of all items from Partnership for that year.

In addition, the statement reports that a 20 percent accuracy-related penalty under section 6662(b) applies. Under \u00a7\u2009301.6226-2(h)(3)(i), because the additional $1,000 in U.S. source dividend income allocated to C is an amount subject to withholding (as defined in \u00a7\u2009301.6226-2(h)(3)(i)), Partnership must pay the amount of tax required to be withheld on the adjustment.

Partnership withholds $100 of tax from C's distributive share, remits the tax to the IRS, and files the necessary return and information returns required by \u00a7\u20091.1461-1 of this chapter.

P is scheduled to attend a three-day seminar on complex real estate transactions, as a participant, at University U, a U.S. university, beginning on a Saturday and ending on the following Monday, which is a holiday. University U has entered into a special acceptance agent agreement with the IRS that permits University U to request an ITIN on an expedited basis. Country Z is a country with which the U.S. has an income tax treaty that exempts certain income earned from the performance of independent personal services from U.S. tax. It is P's first visit to the U.S. On Saturday, prior to the start of the seminar, Professor Q, one of the lecturers at the seminar, cancels his lecture. That same day the Dean of University U offers P $5000, to replace Professor Q at the seminar, payable at the conclusion of the seminar on Monday. P agrees. P gives her lecture Sunday afternoon. ITINs are not available from the IRS on that Saturday, Sunday, or Monday. After the seminar ends on Monday, P, who does not have an ITIN, requests payment for her teaching. P furnishes a beneficial owner withholding certificate, described in \u00a7\u20091.1441-1(e)(2), to University U that represents that P is a resident of Country Z (within the meaning of the U.S.\u2014Z tax treaty) and meets all applicable requirements for claiming benefits under the U.S.\u2014Z tax treaty. The beneficial owner withholding certificate does not, however, contain an ITIN for P.

Regarding the first factor, if the proportion of the fleet that has fishery endorsements changes from the proportion during the baseline period, the likelihood of the ELAPs limit being reached would change accordingly (if the proportion increases, the likelihood would increase). However, because fishing in the U.S. EEZ makes up a relatively small portion of all fishing in the ELAPS, this is a relatively minor factor, and is not examined any further here. Regarding the second factor, the eastern areas of the WCPO have tended to be comparatively more attractive to the U.S. purse seine fleet during El Nino events (versus other times), when warm surface water spreads from the western Pacific to the eastern Pacific and large, valuable yellowfin become more vulnerable to purse seine fishing. Consequently, the ELAPS, much of which is situated in the eastern range of the fleet's fishing grounds, is likely to be more important fishing grounds to the fleet during El Nino events (as compared to neutral or La Nina events). According to the National Weather Service ((see www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/index.shtml), as of June 2017, conditions were ENSO-neutral and the forecast was that ENSO-neutral conditions are favored through the second half of 2017. The 35-50 percent chance of an El Nino developing in the fall of 2017 suggests a slight chance that fishing in the ELAPS could become more important in the latter half of the year, but would only slightly increase the likelihood (than indicated by fishing effort alone) of the proposed 2017 ELAPS limit being reached. Regarding the third factor, effective January 1, 2017, a new treaty is in place between U.S. purse seine vessel owners and the members of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) that allows the U.S. fleet the opportunity to purchase fishing days for use in the EEZs of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA, a subset of eight FFA members in whose waters most WCPO tropical purse seine fishing occurs), and in the EEZs of the other FFA members during the period of the arrangement, which is through 2022). Under the new treaty, vessels notify the U.S. government which in turn informs FFA of the number of treaty days each vessel or group of vessels desires to purchase. These days can be traded among vessels participating in the treaty, and vessels may purchase additional bilateral days during the agreement period if additional days are desired. As each vessel decides on the number of fishing days it wishes to purchase, and vessels can trade and purchase additional bilateral days, it appears that there is a relatively small likelihood of all of the EEZs of the FFA members becoming unavailable to the U.S. fleet before the end of 2017. It is possible that vessels that purchase more treaty days may rely less on the use of ELAPS days whereas vessels that purchase fewer treaty days may rely more heavily on the use of ELAPS days. Regarding the fourth factor, vessels may also choose to fish outside the Convention Area in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). Historically, the fleet fished very little in the EPO, but the numbers of U.S. purse seine vessels fishing in the EPO has been steadily increasing since 2014. Vessels fishing in the EPO are required to be on the IATTC Vessel Register, and can either apply to be on the active purse seine capacity list where they can fish in the EPO during the calendar year or request to use one fishing trip in the EPO that an SPTT-licensed vessel is allowed to make, not to exceed 90 days in length, and there is an annual limit of 32 trips for the entire SPTT-licensed fleet (50 CFR 300.22(b)(1)). If vessels choose to fish in the EPO, this could influence the number of ELAPS days they use, particularly if they opt to fish in the overlap area between the WCPFC and IATTC where their effort would count against the ELAPS limit or fish outside of the area of the overlap where their effort would not count against the ELAPS limit. As of June 2017, 17 U.S. purse seine vessels with WCPFC Area Endorsements are also on the IATTC active purse seine register for 2017.", "metadata": {"end": 323, "title": "International Fisheries; Western and Central Pacific Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species; Fishing Limits in Purse Seine Fisheries for 2017", "start": 298, "key": "treaty", "order_code": 67, "agency": "DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE", "type": "prorule", "phrase": "South Pacific Tuna Treaty", "doc_id": "[FR Doc. 2017-19981 Filed 9-19-17; 8:45 am]"}}, {"id": "8e3cd1f7362f41f0a52321e8823f021a", "annotations": [{"end": 7, "start": 0, "tag": "statute", "overlap": NaN, "value": "The CSA", "example_id": "8e3cd1f7362f41f0a52321e8823f021a"}, {"end": 187, "start": 168, "tag": "statute", "overlap": "f", "value": "21 U.S.C. 811(d)(1)", "example_id": "8e3cd1f7362f41f0a52321e8823f021a"}, {"end": 274, "start": 212, "tag": "Treaty", "overlap": "f", "value": "pursuant to such international treaty, convention, or protocol", "example_id": "8e3cd1f7362f41f0a52321e8823f021a"}, {"end": 274, "start": 266, "tag": "Treaty", "overlap": "f", "value": "protocol", "example_id": "8e3cd1f7362f41f0a52321e8823f021a"}], "content": "The CSA provides for an expedited scheduling action where control is required by the United States obligations under international treaties, conventions, or protocols. 21 U.S.C. 811(d)(1).

In the Military Munitions Rule, at 62 FR 6633, EPA said that states could be more stringent than the federal program for chemical munitions.

We do not expect that allowing Alaska Natives a limited sale of handicrafts containing inedible parts of migratory birds taken during the subsistence season will significantly increase migratory bird harvest rates. There are several reasons for this. First, Alaska subsistence harvest rates have continued to decline over the past years. Second, as discussed above, handcraft items must be created by hand by an Alaska Native, so there would be limited producers of handicrafts. Third, product sales will be limited to being conducted by Alaska Natives or their consignees. Fourth, the market for traditional Alaska Native art is limited and not a major item of commerce, especially when international sale is prohibited. This rule will increase the market for Alaska Native handicrafts containing inedible bird parts given currently there is no legal market; however, we conclude that the increase will not pose a significant environmental impact.

The Commission adopts its proposal, which is supported by nearly all commenters, to modify the band plans of the Upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands from 200 megahertz channels to 100 megahertz channels. The Upper 37 GHz band and the 47 GHz band will now consist of ten 100 megahertz channels each, and the 39 GHz band will consist of fourteen channels. Modifying the band plan to 100 megahertz blocks offers multiple benefits for these bands, including facilitation of the repacking of incumbents, consistency with emerging industry and international standards, and the potential for uniform channel sizes across multiple millimeter wave bands to facilitate secondary market transactions and the standardization of equipment. Further, as noted by commenters, there are potential positive auction effects that would result from standardizing the channel width across the Upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands, which will be auctioned together.

Additionally, UNSCR 2321, unanimously adopted by the UNSC in November 2016, requires nations to close existing representative offices or subsidiaries, branches, or bank accounts in North Korea within 90 days and expel individuals working on behalf of, or at the direction of, a North Korean bank or financial institution.", "metadata": {"title": "Proposal of Special Measure Against Bank of Dandong as a Financial Institution of Primary Money Laundering Concern", "agency": "DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY", "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2017/07/07/2017-14026.html", "type": "prorule", "order_code": 82, "doc_id": "2017-14026"}}, {"id": "b28b759098cc4e45a87c5dec85c53395", "annotations": [{"end": 102, "start": 65, "tag": "Softlaw", "overlap": NaN, "value": "international carrier bond conditions", "example_id": "b28b759098cc4e45a87c5dec85c53395"}], "content": "Section 113.64 of the CBP regulations (19 CFR 113.64) sets forth international carrier bond conditions.

(2) It incorporates Hague procedures into the immigration process for children covered by INA 101(b)(1)(G), most directly by precluding approval of an immigration petition under this classification until the Department has certified that the child was adopted (or legal custody was granted for purposes of emigration and adoption) in accordance with the Convention and the IAA.

This final rule adds a new note to paragraph (c)(1) of License Exception GOV to clarify that civil intergovernmental organizations in which the membership is limited to national governments that are `cooperating governments' are also considered `cooperating governments' for purposes of paragraph (c)(1). The new note provides an example of a civil intergovernmental organization, the European Space Agency (ESA), which BIS has determined to fall within the scope of the definition of `cooperating governments.' ESA (and other civil intergovernmental organizations) are considered `cooperating governments' because their membership is limited to `cooperating governments'\u2014meaning that if an export was made directly to any of organization's national government members, License Exception GOV would be available. On this basis, BIS does not exclude exports, reexports and transfers (in-country) made to ESA (and any other civil intergovernmental organization whose members are `cooperating governments') from License Exception GOV. The purpose of this paragraph (c)(1) is to clarify that the fact that two or more `cooperating governments' are working together does not change the policy rationale for why the United States Government intends to authorize such exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country).

This third sentence also clarifies that this exclusion applies even when some or all of the `cooperating governments' are members of the civil intergovernmental organization. This final rule provides the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the United Nations, and the World Bank as three examples of civil intergovernmental organizations that include members that are `cooperating governments' along with members that are not `cooperating governments,' with the inclusion of the latter group meaning that these civil intergovernmental organizations are not within the scope of paragraph (c)(1).", "metadata": {"end": 225, "title": "Clarifications to the Export Administration Regulations for the Use of License Exceptions", "start": 191, "key": "treaty", "order_code": 27, "agency": "DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE", "type": "rule", "phrase": "North Atlantic Treaty Organization", "doc_id": "[FR Doc. 2017-23712 Filed 10-31-17; 8:45 am]"}}, {"id": "1b34382cafd74e2a95c4698ebadbc44a", "annotations": [{"end": 29, "start": 2, "tag": "Softlaw", "overlap": NaN, "value": "memorandum of understanding", "example_id": "1b34382cafd74e2a95c4698ebadbc44a"}], "content": "A memorandum of understanding between the Government of the Swiss Confederation and the Government of the United States provides for both governments to remove barriers to procurements of conventional defense supplies produced in the other country, and to accord to industries in the other country treatment no less favorable in relation to procurement than is accorded to industries of its own country.

We discussed this issue in a final rule published in the Federal Register on April 2, 2004 (69 FR 17318). If an alternative had been posed in the EA to allow use of inedible parts only from bird species known to be stable or increasing, it would significantly undermine the intended purpose of the proposed regulations, which is to allow the productive use in handicrafts of inedible parts of birds, taken for subsistence purposes, to help Alaska Natives meet their essential needs. We do not expect that allowing Alaska Natives a limited sale of handicrafts containing inedible parts of migratory birds taken during the subsistence season will significantly increase harvest rates or have a significant impact on any of the bird species listed at 50 CFR 92.6(b)(1) or on the environment. There are several reasons for this. First, Alaska subsistence harvest rates have continued to decline over the past years, similarly to declining Alaska sport-hunting harvest rates. Second, as discussed above, handcraft items must be created by hand by an Alaska Native, so there would be limited producers of handicrafts. Third, product sales will be limited to being conducted by Alaska Natives or their consignees. Fourth, the market for traditional Alaska Native art is limited and not a major item of commerce, especially when international sale is prohibited. Also, continued monitoring of the subsistence harvest will enable tracking trends in harvest levels. Thus in the unlikely event that any of the 27 species of birds allowed show substantial population declines, FWS retains the ability both to remove the eligible species at issue from \u00a7\u200992.6(b), and to close the subsistence hunt under \u00a7\u200992.21.", "metadata": {"title": "Migratory Bird Subsistence Harvest in Alaska; Use of Inedible Bird Parts in Authentic Alaska Native Handicrafts for Sale", "agency": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2017/24/07/2017-15465.html", "type": "rule", "order_code": 67, "doc_id": "2017-15465"}}, {"id": "1e92f96e48f84971818a825a8e565fdf", "annotations": [{"end": 114, "start": 56, "tag": "statute", "overlap": NaN, "value": "the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, at 16 U.S.C. 712(1)", "example_id": "1e92f96e48f84971818a825a8e565fdf"}, {"end": 234, "start": 187, "tag": "Treaty", "overlap": "f", "value": "treaties with Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Russia", "example_id": "1e92f96e48f84971818a825a8e565fdf"}], "content": "We derive our authority to issue these regulations from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, at 16 U.S.C. 712(1), which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, in accordance with the treaties with Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Russia, to \u201cissue such regulations as may be necessary to assure that the taking of migratory birds and the collection of their eggs, by the indigenous inhabitants of the State of Alaska, shall be permitted for their own nutritional and other essential needs, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior, during seasons established so as to provide for the preservation and maintenance of stocks of migratory birds.\u201d", "metadata": {"title": "Migratory Bird Subsistence Harvest in Alaska; Use of Inedible Bird Parts in Authentic Alaska Native Handicrafts for Sale", "agency": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2017/24/07/2017-15465.html", "type": "rule", "order_code": 77, "doc_id": "2017-15465"}}, {"id": "f953a0cc43b1456ab0f84d75eb25b115", "annotations": [{"end": 150, "start": 0, "tag": "Foreing Policy", "overlap": NaN, "value": "Because this rule involves a foreign affairs function of the United States, it is not subject to either Executive Order 12866 or Executive Order 13771", "example_id": "f953a0cc43b1456ab0f84d75eb25b115"}], "content": "Because this rule involves a foreign affairs function of the United States, it is not subject to either Executive Order 12866 or Executive Order 13771.", "metadata": {"title": "Extension of Import Restrictions Imposed on Archaeological Objects and Ecclesiastical and Ritual Ethnological Materials From Cyprus", "agency": "DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY", "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2017/14/07/2017-14822.html", "type": "rule", "order_code": 33, "doc_id": "2017-14822"}}, {"id": "de53c8c8d9af4a72884490c120468283", "annotations": [{"end": 59, "start": 49, "tag": "Foreing Policy", "overlap": NaN, "value": "rulemaking", "example_id": "de53c8c8d9af4a72884490c120468283"}, {"end": 106, "start": 89, "tag": "Foreing Policy", "overlap": "f", "value": "national security", "example_id": "de53c8c8d9af4a72884490c120468283"}], "content": "Questions for the Public: The FAA is considering rulemaking to address public safety and national security concerns associated with small UAS and invites input from the public as follows\u2014", "metadata": {"title": "Safe and Secure Operations of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems", "agency": "DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION", "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2019/13/02/2019-00758.html", "type": "prorule", "order_code": 128, "doc_id": "2019-00758"}}, {"id": "6ea4597c8f7e4186a07f4cc14d05724e", "annotations": [{"end": 98, "start": 5, "tag": "Foreing Policy", "overlap": NaN, "value": "From which fish or shellfish are or could be taken and sold in interstate or foreign commerce", "example_id": "6ea4597c8f7e4186a07f4cc14d05724e"}], "content": "(ii) From which fish or shellfish are or could be taken and sold in interstate or foreign commerce; or", "metadata": {"title": "Definition of \u201cWaters of the United States\u201d\u2014Recodification of Pre-Existing Rules", "agency": "DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE", "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2017/27/07/2017-13997.html", "type": "prorule", "order_code": 249, "doc_id": "2017-13997"}}, {"id": "39e0fb3c0f524986bb35ccdf9b562c27", "annotations": [{"end": 80, "start": 76, "tag": "statute", "overlap": NaN, "value": "FQPA", "example_id": "39e0fb3c0f524986bb35ccdf9b562c27"}, {"end": 169, "start": 134, "tag": "Softlaw", "overlap": "f", "value": "Codex Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs)", "example_id": "39e0fb3c0f524986bb35ccdf9b562c27"}], "content": "EPA is working to ensure that the U.S. tolerance reassessment program under FQPA does not disrupt international trade.

Spectrum sharing in this context refers to the use of automated techniques to facilitate the coexistence of disparate unaffiliated spectrum dependent systems that would conventionally require separate bands to avoid interference. Such coexistence may happen, for example, by authorizing targeted use of new commercial systems in specific geographical areas where interference into incumbent systems is not a problem.
